          <h2>Reimagining a classic specialty coffee shop.</h2>
          <p>Cafés Roure is an emblematic establishment in the Sant Antoni neighborhood, known for its variety of high-quality specialty coffees at an affordable price.
            <br><br>
            It is an old and neighborhood place, without any online presence. The objective of the project was to create an e-commerce for the premises, giving it a new image to attract new users and strengthen the most characteristic aspects of Cafès Roure, plurality and classics.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the place and it’s users.</h2>
          <p>Before we could start brainstorming and designing the site for Cafès Roure, we had to understand it first. We followed the Design Thinking methodology thoughout the whole project, so the first step was to emphatize.
            <br><br>
            We did a benchmark of similar shops in the neighbourhood and we conducted online surveys and interviews with clients to understand their needs.
            <br><br>
            After all research was done, we constructed 3 personas that would help us keep a good direction during the design process.

          <h2>Building the solution.</h2>
          <p>To develop the different pages, based on the research, an information architecture and some wireframes were designed.
            <br><br>
            To develop the architecture and functionalities, we wanted to offer users different ways to get to the product. That is why we offer a coffee menu, a recommender and an explorer of the countries of the world (that have coffee in the store).</p>

          <h2>Mixing classical and modern.</h2>
          <p>For the main aesthetic of the website, we wanted to merge both the old school and classic style of Cafés Roure, with the plurality of the different countries that the different coffees found there come from.
            <br><br>
            The collage seemed to us a perfect fusion of this classic style with different more modern or diverse elements.</p>

              <h2>Offering an elegant solution.</h2>
              <p>We built a complete new identity for cafès Roure. It is disruptive, but transmits the classy vibe with the plurality that defines the shop.
                <br><br>
                Based on this new identity, I we built a complete design system including all necessary components and states for the product MVP.
                <br><br>
                I was quite involved in this part of the project, all parent elements are editable, animated and offer great customization.</p>
