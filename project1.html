          <h2>Understanding what affects sleep and how to improve it.</h2>
          <p>To make such a promise, we had to investigate thoroughly. First, we researched the different causes for bad sleep that can happen during the day. Since itâ€™s a very wide number of factors, we focused on hormones, how they affect sleep and what impacts in their generation.
            <br><br>
            With this study done, we knew what activities and habits could enhance sleep on our users. The next step was to check with our users what they were doing during the day to see how we could help them. We did that using shadowing techniques and interviews.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, we did a bit of research on similar apps and how they try to solve this issue, as well as business models.

          <h2>Building the solution.</h2>
          <p>Once we had all our research done, we focused on ideas for the solution. We cerated an aplication that gives advive on activities that can improve sleep. Users can ray to convert this advice in habits. Statistics about sleep and daily activities that impact sleep are also shown in this app, with advice to enhance them individually.
            <br><br>
            We designed the architecture of the app to be really smple, separating home, habits, statistics and a record. With the advice card being present in all of them.</p>

          <p>For the main aesthetic of the app, we wanted something elegant and simple. Somethn easy to understand for its users.
            <br><br>
            We created a design system with clear colors with good contrast, a readable typography and a system of buttons, icons and illustrations that worked well together.</p>
